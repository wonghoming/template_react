# React boilerplate

## Purpose
This repository will be a boilerplate for react apps, similar to **create-react-app**. The reason is for creating this instead of using **create-react-app** is to learn the mechanics behind **React** such as **Babel** and **Webpack**.

## Tech stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Koa
- **Unit/Component testing**: Jest with Enzyme
- **E2E testing**: Cypress
- **C/I**: Travis
